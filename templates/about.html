	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Dot Gov Domains is a project intended to provide an easily accessible means of sifting through state and federal .gov domains, and examining the assorted properties involved with different domains. Currently, you can examine either federal or state domains. The state domain set excludes domains from U.S. territories, the District of Columbia and tribal nations. Several data sets including these domains can be found in <a href="http://www.github.com/alexlitel/dot-gov-domains">the project's Github repo</a>. Data comes from the <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/gov-domains-api-c9856">GSA's .Gov Domains API</a> and <a href="https://pulse.cio.gov/https/domains/">18F's HTTPS pulse project</a>. The data has been lightly edited (mostly for presentational purposes), but there may still be inaccuracies.</p>
	<p>This is an open-source project. If you notice any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to contribute <a href="http://www.github.com/alexlitel/dot-gov-domains">via Github</a> or <a href="mailto:alexlitelATgmailDOTcom?Subject=Dot%20Gov%20Domains%20project%20feedback%20">send an email</a>. You can also fork the project, steal the idea for another country's version of '.gov,' or use any of the aforementioned associated data as you wish.</p>
